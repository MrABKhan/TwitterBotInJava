# TwitterBotInJava
This is WIP of a Twitter Bot which will get top tweets from defined tweet sources and apply sentiment analysis to them and then generate tweets on that data for specific bias set.

## TODO List:

## Java Bot for Sending Tweets:
It uses the Twitter4J library for sending tweets. For Testing purposes I have included the list of tweets in a text file for checking purposes.
