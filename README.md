# TwitterBotInJava
This is WIP of a Twitter Bot which will get top tweets from defined tweet sources and apply sentiment analysis to them and then generate tweets on that data for specific bias set.

## TODO List:
- [x] Java Bot for Sending Tweets
- [ ] Sentiment Analysis of Data
- [ ] Java Bot for gathering Tweet Data.

## Java Bot for Sending Tweets
It uses the Twitter4J library for sending tweets. For Testing purposes I have included the list of tweets in a text file for checking purposes.
### Usage:
1. Import Project using Maven in any IDE.
2. Add your Twitter API OAuth Keys to the *twitter4j.properties* file.
3. Run! 

#### Note: 
This bot tweets every 30 minutes. I will modify it's behaviour as time moves on and I complete the other parts of the project.
