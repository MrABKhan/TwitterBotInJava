# TwitterBotInJava
It uses the Twitter4J library for sending tweets. For Testing purposes I have included the list of tweets in a text file for checking purposes.
### Usage:
1. Import Project using Maven in any IDE.
2. Add your Twitter API OAuth Keys to the *twitter4j.properties* file.
3. Run! 

#### Note: 
This bot tweets every 30 minutes. I will modify it's behaviour as time moves on and I complete the other parts of the project.
